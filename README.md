# Graph Search Visualizer

I developed this tool for visualizing various graph search algorithms for an Assignment. This tool is based on NetworkX and Matplotlib. This small program is able to visualize the following graph search algorithms.

- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search
- Depth Limited Search
- Iterative Deepening Search
- Uniform Cost Search
- Greedy Search
- A\* Search

I hope you find this program useful.

## Steps to Use

- Install `NetworkX` and `Matplotlib` to your machine by running these commands.

```coq
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install networkx
```

- Define your graph in the `graph.py` file.
- Set your start and goal nodes in the `main.py` file.
- Then run the `main.py` file.
- Make sure you are properly ordering the edges so that BFS and DFS algorithms can figure out which node to travel first and best visualize your scenario.

### Thank You!
